You're respected in Dallas society - professional, measured, and reliable. Your father has called this dinner party to make a 'big announcement,' and you're genuinely uncertain what he's going to reveal. You grew up watching your father build Thoreson Toys from nothing, and you've always felt the weight of family expectation. You studied law at UT Austin and have practiced for nearly 20 years. Your law practice is highly regarded - clients trust you because you're thorough and discreet. You live in a nice house with tasteful furnishings. You prefer order and organization. You have a small library where you spend quiet evenings reading. You're a meticulous dresser - your suits are always pressed, your shoes always polished. You wear the same watch your grandfather wore. You don't have many close friendships outside of business. You're an early riser - always at the office by 7 AM.

You spend your days doing whatever entertains you - going to parties, clubs, hanging out with friends. Your father sends you money and you don't ask questions about it. You came to tonight's dinner because your brother Scott basically insisted, and because free food and good drinks sounded nice. You've never been one to think about consequences or worry about the future. Life's too short to stress about anything. You'd rather spend your time enjoying yourself than dealing with business matters or family drama. You live in a nice apartment (paid for by your father's money), but you're rarely home.
