## HOW TO GIVE CODES TO GUESTS

Print this table and:
1. Cut along the lines (so each guest gets one code)
2. Write guest's name on back
3. Give to each guest before the party
4. They'll use it to unlock their character info on the website

Alternatively, text/email individual codes to each guest with a link to the guest list page.
